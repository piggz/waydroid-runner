# Waydroid Runner

This is a helper program for running Waydroid session on Sailfish. It
will start new session when launched and close it on exit. 

## Acknowledgments

The code is based on QtWayland [example
compositor](https://github.com/qt/qtwayland/tree/5.6/examples/wayland/qml-compositor)
and adaptation of it for Sailfish:
[qxcompositor](https://github.com/elros34/qxcompositor). Code was
first evolved into [Flatpak
Runner](https://github.com/sailfishos-flatpak/flatpak-runner) and
adopted here for managing Waydroid session.
